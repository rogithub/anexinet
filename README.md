# Test

1. Write a function that adds two numbers without using any arithmetic operators.

2. Given 2 strings of unknown characters (but it cannot be repeated) create a function that returns an array of the characters that are repeated in both strings in
the most efficient way.

3. Write a function that takes a string containing a number in base X along with an integer of the base X. The function must return the integer value of that
string/base pair. E.g.,
``` JavaScript
int ConverToDecimal(string number, int base)
{
// Your code here
}
```
Pay close attention to string validation against base.

4. Write a function such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0 , its entire row and column are set to 0 and then printed out.
``` JavaScript
// Original input
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 0, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
// Result
[
    [1, 0, 3],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [7, 0, 9]
]
```

5. Write a function that convert the given number into a Roman Numeral - The function needs to receive a Number and Return a String (The Number can be
between 1 and 3999)
Example:
getRomanNumeral(512);
Prints: DXII

6. Write a function to print all permutations of a string. Max string length can be 50 characters.

7. Write a function that receives a sentence, and return the longest word, if two or more words has the same lenght, they are returned as an array, but can't return
duplicated words.
